\subsection{Additional non-convex experiments}\label{subsec:additional_experiments_nonconvex}
In addition to the Toy GAN results reported in Chapter~\ref{chap:decoupled_gradient_descent_ascent}, we conducted further non-convex experiments to inspect the trajectories of Decoupled GDA. These plots illustrate how the iterates move in parameter space under different values of the interaction parameter and different choices of local steps $K$. For brevity, we only summarize these observations here; the main qualitative behaviour matches the discussion in Section~\ref{subsec:experiment2}.
